This philosophical idea emphasizes individual freedom and choice, as well as personal responsibility for one\\'s actions and decisions. The main character, Meursault, embodies this philosophy through his actions and thoughts, which demonstrate a sense of detachment from societal expectations and norms.\\n\\nExistentialism suggests that people must take ownership of their lives and create their own meaning, rather than relying on external sources such as society or tradition. Camus\\' protagonist is often described as an \"anomaly\" or a \"stranger\" because he does not conform to the expected emotional responses to life\\'s events, such as crying at his mother\\'s funeral.\\n\\nThe book encourages readers to question societal expectations and values, and to explore their own beliefs and values in order to create a more authentic and meaningful life. Through Meursault\\'s character, Camus illustrates the importance of individual choice and responsibility, and the need for people to forge their own paths in life rather than following the crowd.\\n\\nOverall, \"The Stranger\" is a classic example of existentialist philosophy, exploring themes of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent world.'"
